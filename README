OVERVIEW

Jewel is software library written in standard C++, using C++11 features,
containing classes, functions and macros which may be useful in a variety of
C++ programs, but which have no particular common theme. The library was
developed by Matthew Harvey, originally for use in his own projects, and is
released in the hope that it will be useful to others.

Some (but not all) of the facilities contained in the Jewel library are:

	Assertion macros;
	A static string class template;
	Functions for testing the safety of arithmetic operations;
	A decimal number class;
	A general base exception class;
	A macro for succinctly creating further exception classes;
	A class template for managing sets of boolen flags;
	Logging facilities; and
	A very simple stopwatch.


DOCUMENTATION

HTML documentation for the library can be generated by running Doxygen (see
INSTALL file). Almost all of the Doxygen markup is contained in the
C++ headers; so an alternative source of information on the Jewel API, is
simply to examine the headers directly.
